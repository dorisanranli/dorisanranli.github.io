<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi! I am an associate professor at the Department of Decisions, Operations and Technology at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk). Prior to joining CUHK, I was a faculty member at the Department of Management, [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/management). I received my PhD in Operations Research from [Columbia University](https://ieor.columbia.edu).

I am interested in designing algorithms and analysing data in order to optimise supply chain decisions. In the past, my research has been focusing on developing and estimating consumer choice models using econometric tools, optimising assortment and recommendation for both traditional retailing and online digital platform, and creating a fair marketplace for all shareholders. I am passionate about bringing impacts to practice through the work.
